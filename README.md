#Apollon's Eye
###21st century's space disaster prevention platform

In order to prevent disease or accidents coming from the universe, data coming live from space is visualized.

The solar winds generates a beautiful aurora caused by the solar activity. The high energy particles coming from the sun are not visible to the naked eye. However, they can have a big impact on our lives. Our platform is intended to alert you in every day's life, via visualization of the solar activity by smart glasses(EPSON MOVERIO), smartphones, and controllable LED bulbs(Philips hue).

##Purpose
Simplify the visualization of the solar wind; which is unseen to the naked eye, and make if possible to every one, young and old to see it clearly.

##How It Works
Positioned exactly between the Sun and Earth, The satellite ACE receives solar wind early on and transmits it back to earth in form of data, this data is treated by LED bulbs, Smart phones and Smart glasses to generate an alert system.

1 - Alerting with LED bulbs:  
Used normally as interior lighting elements, LED bulbs glow red when the value of solar wind is higher than usual, thus giving a clear warning signal.

2 - Checking Smart phones and Smart glasses:  
Taking advantage of LED bulbs Alert, more detailed information can be checked by Smart phones or Smart glasses.
